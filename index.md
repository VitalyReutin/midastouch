Midas Touch is an attempt bring the story of Midas to life through projection mapping.  Models are created using 123DCatch and imported into Unity3D, which employs an XBox Kinect to perform single-hand tracking, so that when a user touches an installed object (in our case, a slice of pizza), the food item is turned to gold.
